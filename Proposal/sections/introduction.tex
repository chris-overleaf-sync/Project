\section{Introduction}
We want to tackle adversarial machine learning. With the increased use of machine learning in domains such as self-driving cars, security is becoming more important. Adversaries can make slight modifications to inputs that arenâ€™t noticeable to humans, ultimately causing potentially malicious misclassifications with high confidence. We will tackle the problem of adversarial example generation, which is, given an input X, create a new image X' that will cause the original network to misclassify X', but keep the distance between X and X' small.
