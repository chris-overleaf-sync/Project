\begin{abstract}
In this work we create a new adversarial attack called Partial Iterative FGSM, and evaluate with the Madry MNIST challenge library. Our methods selectively perturb pixels with larger gradient magnitudes for multiple iterations. We find that our 'Clipped Pixels' attack produces the best results with attack accuracy 92.31\%. This performs worse than the reported white-box results but is competitive with the best attack reported for the MNIST challenge.
